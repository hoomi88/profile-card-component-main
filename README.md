## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

A bit of playing aroung with the background images.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.body {
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-blend-mode: screen;
  background-position: right 52vw bottom 35vh, left 48vw top 52vh;
}
```

### Continued development

Need to continue learning how to align items within parent item. Background items alignment still requires improvements.

### Useful resources

The usual suspects. W3SCHOOLS and Google.
